               I am currently learning basic HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, and networking concepts like IP addressing and 
               subnetting. Since this is my first year in the course, I still have a lot to explore, practice, and learn.

            <p>
               I am a dedicated learner. I am very patient when solving problems and always 
               try to improve myself by learning from my mistakes, gaining new ideas, 
               and practicing regularly to become better.
