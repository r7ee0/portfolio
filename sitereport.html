<h2>Overall</h2>

<p>
While I created this website, I learned how to create web
pages using HTML and style them using CSS. The process was a bit challenging and time consuming
with layout and positioning, but through practice and testing, it was worth the time
because I got improve my skills and improved my expericences.
This project helped me gain confidence in web development and learn more 
about the importance of organizing a proper portfolio and the usage of  GitHub.
