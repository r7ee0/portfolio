        <p>
            This site report shows the progress of my portfolio website for the
            Web Development module. The main purpose of this website is to present my skills,
            learning progress, and personal information in an easily understandable 
            and organized way. I chose a beautiful dark red colour whith peach coloured 
            boxes beacause I personally like them a lot and they make the webiste
            look warm and very appealing.
        </p>

        <h2>Home Page</h2>

        <p>
            This is the first pager of the website.
            The home page introduces the portfolio and gives a first impression to the 
            visitors. It doesn,t contain much information as they are going to be reprenented 
            on the upcomming pages. It is designed simple with a unique color theme.
        </p>

        <h2>About me Page</h2>
        <img src="r2.png" alt="About me page screenshot">
        <p>
            The second page is about me section. In this part, I've written some 
            inforamtions about myself that includes my interests, personal qualities,
            and what i am currently learning. This page helps the visitors understand
            more about me and my background. I wanted this section to have honesty, so 
            it actually defines who I really am.
        </p>

        <h2>Projects</h2>
        <img src="r3.png" alt="Project page screenshot">
        <p>
            The third page is about Projects. Since I'm just a 
            beginner to this field, I've hot completed any projects,
            but I wanted to show the template from what I've learned.
            However, it has been kept intentionally, as it will be updated
            in the future when I start adding my work.
        </p>

        <h2>Concluison</h2>
        <p>
            While creating this website, I learned how to build web pages using HTML and CSS.  
            The process was challenging and time-consuming, but through practice, I improved my skills.  
            This project helped me gain confidence in web development, organize a proper portfolio, and use GitHub effectively.
